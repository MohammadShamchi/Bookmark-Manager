## üìã **Copy this prompt for new Cursor IDE sessions:**

```
I'm working on an AI-powered Chrome bookmark manager extension. Here's the current status:

**Project:** AI-Powered Chrome Bookmark Manager  
**Tech Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Chrome Extension Manifest V3, Tailwind CSS  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ - Ready for Phase 2 (OpenAI Integration)  

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects bookmark creation in real-time
- Smart categorizes bookmarks using URL/keyword patterns  
- Creates AI-prefixed folders (üõ†Ô∏è AI-Tools, üíº AI-Work, etc.) to prevent Chrome sync conflicts
- Modern React popup interface with Tailwind CSS

**Critical Context:**
- Recently fixed Chrome sync conflicts by using AI-prefixed folder names
- Extension works correctly with comprehensive error handling
- All documentation is up-to-date in .md files
- Ready for OpenAI API integration (Phase 2)

**Key Files:**
- `src/background/service-worker.ts` - Real-time bookmark detection
- `src/services/categories.ts` - Smart categorization logic  
- `src/popup/App.tsx` - React UI interface
- `src/utils/constants.ts` - AI-prefixed folder names
- `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete project context

**Next Priority:** Phase 2 - OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration for enhanced AI categorization

Please read the AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md file for complete context, then help me continue development.
